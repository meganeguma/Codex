# Marketing Demo Site

This repository demonstrates a simple ROI Calculator front-end with GitHub Actions CI/CD. The workflow runs linting, unit tests, generates documentation and diagrams, and deploys the site to GitHub Pages.

Open `dist/index.html` after running `npm run build` or visit the GitHub Pages site once deployed.
